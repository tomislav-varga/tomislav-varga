## 💡 About Me  

I’m an aspiring **Junior DevOps Engineer** with a strong foundation in IT support and full-stack web development.  

- 🎓 Earlier this year, I completed an **online coding bootcamp**, where I built web applications using **React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS**.  
- 🛠 I recently started an **internship at Kubecraft**, where I’m gaining hands-on experience with **Kubernetes, Linux, and cloud-native technologies** — all while continuing to work full-time in IT.  
- 💼 With **3+ years in IT support**, I bring proven problem-solving skills, the ability to communicate clearly with both technical and non-technical users, and experience troubleshooting under pressure.  

I'm now looking for an **entry-level position** where I can contribute, learn, and grow as part of a passionate software engineering team.
