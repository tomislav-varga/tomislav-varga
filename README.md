## Hi there 👋

### About me  
I'm Tomi, a motivated and detail-oriented individual with a passion for coding and problem-solving. With a background in IT support, I've always been fascinated by the world of technology, and I've recently taken my skills to the next level.

This year, I completed an online coding bootcamp with a focus on web development and backend technologies. Throughout this journey, I gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, React, and Express. These tools have not only deepened my understanding of software development but also sparked a desire to build innovative solutions. As part of the final project, I collaborated closely with a team, gaining experience in working within a shared codebase and contributing to a common goal.

In addition to my technical skills, I bring over 5 years of experience in IT support, where I've honed my ability to analyze problems, prioritize tasks, and communicate clearly with stakeholders.  
Currently, I'm expanding my skill set by learning Python and Go. My knowledge also includes Linux fundamentals, which enable me to navigate the command line with confidence.  
I'm now seeking an entry-level position that will allow me to apply my skills in a real-world setting. If you're looking for a driven individual who's eager to learn and grow — let's connect!
