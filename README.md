## 💡 About Me  

I currently work in IT support, where I help people solve everyday technical issues and keep their systems running smoothly.

Over the last couple of months, I’ve been spending my free time learning Linux-related tools and technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible. I enjoy understanding how systems work under the hood and how automation can make them more reliable and efficient.

My goal is to transition from my current role into a position in **DevOps** or **Linux system administration**, where I can work closer to infrastructure, automation, and cloud-native systems.
