### 🚀 About Me

I'm a motivated **Junior Full Stack Web Developer** with a background in IT support and a strong passion for building useful, well-crafted digital products.

Earlier this year, I completed an **online coding bootcamp**, where I built web apps using modern technologies like **React**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Tailwind CSS**. During this time, I also collaborated on team projects and worked in shared codebases using Git and GitHub.

Before diving into development, I spent over **5 years in IT support**, where I learned how to troubleshoot under pressure, communicate clearly with non-technical users, and solve real-world problems.

While working full time, I dedicate time to deepening my understanding of programming concepts — especially through **Python**, **Go**, and **hands-on projects**.

I'm now looking for an **entry-level position** where I can contribute, learn, and grow as part of a passionate development team.
