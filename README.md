## 💡 About Me  

Hi! I work in IT support, where I help people solve everyday tech issues and keep their systems running smoothly.  

🧑‍💻 In my free time, I love exploring programming and learning how things work behind the scenes.  
⚙️ I’m especially interested in Linux, automation, and DevOps tools — not as a career path, but because I genuinely enjoy tinkering and learning new technologies.  
💬 I also like to spend a lot of time in the terminal.
